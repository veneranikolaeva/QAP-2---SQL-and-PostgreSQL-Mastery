# PostgreSQL Assignment: Database Design and Implementation

This repository contains the solution for the SQL and PostgreSQL QAP focusing on the design and implementation of two database systems:

*   **Problem 1: University Course Enrollment System:**  This system manages students, professors, courses, and their enrollments. The database schema includes tables for students, professors, courses, and enrollments, with appropriate foreign key constraints.  The SQL scripts include `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO`, `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to demonstrate various database operations.

*   **Problem 2: Online Store Inventory and Orders System:** This system manages products, customers, orders, and order items.  The database schema includes tables for products, customers, orders, and order items.  The scripts demonstrate the creation of tables, data insertion, queries to retrieve information about products, customers, and orders, updating stock quantities, and removing an order.

The `sql_scripts` directory contains the SQL scripts for both problems.  The associated Word document provides a visual expression of the executed queries.
